## ✅ What Works Right Now

| Component | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Pipeline** | ✅ | Obscura → IXL + MathIsFun → LLM → 40 MCQs |
| **LLM** | ✅ | OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (primary). Azure authenticated but **no deployment** (404). Grok exhausted. |
| **Database** | ✅ | **SQLite** with SQLAlchemy (replaces JSON files). Tables: `prompts`, `topics`, `generations`, `evaluations`, `grounding_logs` |
| **Prompt Builder** | ✅ | Create custom teaching personas. **Auto-versioning** — edits create timestamped sub-versions. Full text expand/collapse. |
| **Manager Lab** | ✅ | `/lab` — rate generations 1–5⭐, see prompt leaderboard, A/B compare, view per-generation pipeline timeline |
| **Generation History** | ✅ | **All versions kept** (not just latest). Every generation records a 4-step timeline: scrape → adapt → generate → save. |
| **Grounding** | ✅ | Every generation logs IXL skills + MathIsFun URL used |
| **Web UI** | ✅ | FastAPI + Jinja2. Home, topic pages, prompt builder, history, lab, compare |
| **Nursing PWA** | ✅ | `/nursing/` daily 5-question quiz, offline fallback, share-to-WhatsApp, installable manifest + service worker |
| **Privacy & Consent** | ✅ | DPDPA notice at `/nursing/privacy`, consent banner, conditional share, withdrawal link |
| **Nursing Analytics** | ✅ | Anonymous `sendBeacon` events gated by `mw_privacy_consent`; JSONL retention 30 days |
| **Web-to-APK Conversion** | ✅ | UTM-tagged prompts on result, landing banner, share text; `apk_download_clicked` + `app_first_open` events |
| **Native App Analytics Consent** | ✅ | One-time in-app dialog; separate `mw_native_consent` record; DPDPA-aligned |
| **Native APK network permissions** | ✅ | `INTERNET` + `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` added to `AndroidManifest.xml`; fixes installed-APK "No internet connection" error |
| **Pre-commit** | ✅ | Blocks `.env`, runtime artifacts, `__pycache__`. Enforces conventional commits. |
| **Docker** | ✅ | `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + nginx configs ready |
| **Deploy automation** | ✅ | `scripts/deploy.sh` installs nginx config, selects SSL, copies static assets, reloads nginx, health-checks endpoints |

---

## ❌ Blockers / Not Working

| Item | Why | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| **Live deploy** | ✅ Done | System nginx proxies to Docker app on localhost:8000 |
| **Azure OpenAI** | No model deployment exists | Optional — OpenAI working fine |
| **HTTPS/SSL** | ✅ Done | Let's Encrypt ECDSA cert active; auto-renewal cron set |
| **Student session UI** | Not built yet | Phase after manager workflow stabilizes |
| **DPDPA privacy notice** | ✅ Done | `/nursing/privacy` live with consent banner |
| **Flutter release build** | ✅ Done | Jetifier ignore-list + ABI filter; `flutter build apk --release` succeeds |
| **Release APK size** | ✅ Done | 15.4 MB (target ≤ 20 MB) |
| **HomeScreen / app-wide narrow-screen overflow** | ✅ Done | 320–430 dp responsive pass; visual tests now use correct logical viewports |

## 🗄️ Database Schema (SQLite)

```
prompts              → id, name, system_prompt, question_prompt, created_at
topics               → id, slug, name, created_at
generations          → id, topic_id, prompt_id, status, total_questions,
                       difficulty_distribution, adapted_content, questions_json,
                       raw_html_path, antigravity_path, meta, created_at
evaluations          → id, generation_id, rating (1-5), notes, created_at
grounding_logs       → id, generation_id, source_type, source_url,
                       content_snippet, verification_status, created_at
```

**Key behavior:** Every `run_pipeline()` call creates a `generations` row. Re-generating the same topic appends a new row — old versions are never overwritten. This is intentional for manager A/B testing.

## 🧪 Manager Workflow (Current)

1. Go to **🎨 Prompts** → Create a teaching style
2. Go to **🏠 Home** → Generate topic with that prompt
3. Go to **🧪 Lab** → Rate output 1–5⭐, add notes
4. Generate **same topic again** with different prompt
5. Go to **⚖️ Compare** (`/compare?a=1&b=2`) → Side-by-side diff
6. Check **🏆 Leaderboard** → Which prompt has highest avg rating?

No passwords. Open access.

## 📦 Generated Topics (DB)

| Topic | Versions | Prompts Used | Evaluations |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rational Numbers | 1 | Default | ⭐ 5.0 (1 eval) |
| Exponents | 1 | Default | ⭐ 4.0 (1 eval) |
| Integers | 1 | Default | — |
| Fractions | 1 | Default | — |
| Triangles | 1 | Default | — |
| Percentage | 1 | Default | — |
| Nursing Staff Nurse | 1 | Default | — |

> Note: 6 topics exist as JSON files from earlier runs. DB migration captured 2 generations (Rational Numbers, Exponents). Re-generating any topic will create a fresh DB row.

## 🎯 Next Immediate Work

1. **Phase 10.8+** — Monitor APK conversion funnel (`apk_prompt_shown` → `apk_download_clicked` → `app_first_open`) for at least 100 impressions; decide whether to spike a Play Console release based on click-to-open gap.
2. **~~Phase 10.8a~~ ✅** — Characterization tests for `pipeline/run.py` and core web routes committed.
3. **🟡 Phase 10.8b** — Decouple math pipeline: create `pipeline/interfaces.py`, implement LLM/scraper/content-store ports, and introduce `GenerateContentUseCase` behind a compatibility wrapper.
4. **Phase 10.8c** — Web composition root: inject `NursingService`, extract `AnalyticsSink`, and split `web/main.py` into focused routers incrementally.
5. **Phase 10.9** — WhatsApp daily quiz reminder experiment: explicit opt-in flow, BSP evaluation (Chat Mitra Starter / Meta Cloud API), Meta template approval, backend scheduler + STOP handling, cost/engagement reversal trigger. **Gated by Phase 10.8c.**
6. **Phase 10.10** — Expand nursing seed bank to 100 verified questions across INC GNM domains with `source_url`, `source_section`, and `verified_at` metadata.
7. **ADR-024** — Write Architecture Decision Record for WhatsApp channel choice, consent model, and data retention before any bot code is merged.
8. **ADR-025** — Write Architecture Decision Record for pragmatic SOLID refactor strategy (ports for volatile boundaries, Strangler Fig, delete `src/`).
9. **Structural cleanup** — Delete empty `src/` tree, update `AGENTS.md`, remove runtime artifacts from production Docker image.
10. **Manager requests features** — export ratings CSV, bulk generate, prompt templates from research personas.

# Check DB health
python3 -c "from db.database import SessionLocal; from db.models import Generation; db=SessionLocal(); print('Generations:', db.query(Generation).count())"

# Start web app locally

# Verify Docker Compose config
docker compose config

# Deploy to server (run ON the server)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Enable SSL (run ON the server, after DNS works)
./scripts/init-ssl.sh

# Nursing smoke test
